<p>The first word that comes to my friends mind when they think of me is "curious". Ok, maybe it's "lazy", but nonetheless, you get the point. I believe that curiosity takes the best out of us and makes us better selves.</p>

<p>I am a developer pursuing my Indian dream in Gurgaon. I did my majors in Comptuer Science from VIT (google it, it's recognized and shit) and currently working in Sapient Consulting. I dabble in IOT (Internet of Things), Big Data (woah!), Web Scraping, Data Analysis and its Visualization.</p>

<p>I'm a huge movie buff and an avid food blogger. I like techie stuff and worships Reddit.</p>
